If you try to open the project without the correct Android Studio or Java setup, you may encounter errors like "Unsupported JDK version" or "Gradle sync failed".
Make sure to update your Android Studio and install the correct JDK through the SDK Manager or your system settings.

Once you can successfully launch Android Studio, download the project zip folder

Once extracted, open the folder in  Android Studio
